  <h1>Firefox and Chromium Security</h1>

  <p>
    Chromium is far more secure than Firefox. Firefox lacks many security features that Chromium has such as <a
      href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">site isolation</a>, <a
      href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md">a
      hardened memory allocator</a> (<a
      href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/build/mozjemalloc.cpp">mozjemalloc</a> is just a few
    security features tacked on to jemalloc and <a
      href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2019-August/013990.html">is not similar to a hardened memory
      allocator</a>), <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity">Control-Flow
      Integrity</a> and many more. Firefox's current security features such as its <a
      href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">browser sandbox</a> are a lot worse than Chromium's. Excluding
    the issue of site isolation, only the Firefox sandbox on Windows is similar to Chromium's. The others are very
    insecure and the Linux sandbox can hardly be called a sandbox at all as there are many trivial escapes such as the
    <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1129492">X11 server</a> (this is also a 5 year old, critical
    issue). <br>
    <br>
    Just look at what security experts such as <a
      href="https://medium.com/@thegrugq/tor-and-its-discontents-ef5164845908">thegrugq</a> and <a
      href="https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing">Daniel Micay</a> have to say about Firefox.
