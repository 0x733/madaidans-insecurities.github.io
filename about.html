  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    This website contains a lot of information on certain security-related topics and aims to dispell common
    misinformation. I was requested by various people to create a website with all my opinions so here it is. <br>
    <br>
    My most common alias is "madaidan" and you can contact me through various means such as Reddit.
