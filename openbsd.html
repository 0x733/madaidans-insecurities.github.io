  <h1>OpenBSD</h1>

  <p>
    OpenBSD is lacking in a lot of ways. Many of its exploit mitigations are half-baked/useless such as its <a
      href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160527203200">W^X</a> which can be bypassed by transitioning a
    writable memory mapping to executable or <a
      href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20170622065629">TRAPSLED</a> which doesn't actually make
    exploitation harder in the era of ASLR. <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD is also missing many important security features such as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">CFI</a>, <a
      href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html">SafeStack</a>, <a
      href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">verified boot</a>, <a
      href="http://phrack.org/issues/52/6.html#article">TPE</a> and a lot more. OpenBSD hasn't innovated much and many
    of its (real) mitigations were developed long before OpenBSD implemented them such as W^X and ASLR which <a
      href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">were developed by PaX</a> (PAX_MPROTECT and PAX_ASLR). <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD has a non-existent desktop security model. It does not have any MAC implementation to fully lock down
    userspace and lacks any GUI isolation. <br>
    <br>
    OpenBSD has received criticism from many respected security experts. One example is <a
      href="https://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/exp_moosecox.c">Brad Spengler</a>, the developer of grsecurity.

    This website goes in-depth into the issues with most of OpenBSD's mitigations: <a

    <br>
    A more promising alternative to OpenBSD is <a href="https://hardenedbsd.org/">HardenedBSD</a>. There are
    advantages/disadvantages of HardenedBSD over OpenBSD. HardenedBSD has many mitigations OpenBSD does not such as CFI,
    SafeStack, SEGVGUARD, a proper W^X implementation and more but it lacks things OpenBSD has such as LibreSSL, a
    hardened malloc etc.
